                <p class="bio">I want to start by mentioning my grandma Wanda. She has been the most influential person in my life.
                    I did not realize it until I was older how much she did for me growing up. 
                    She took care of me almost every day since my parents worked. 
                    She taught me how to cook, clean, dress up, basically, to be an adult. 
                    She would also take me shopping and getting my hair done etc. I loved it!
                </p>
    
                <p class="bio">Iâ€™m currently a nurse manager at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. 
                    I first became interested in nursing thanks to my high school friend Tori. 
                    She talked me into joining a regional occupational program (ROP) as a nurse assistant. 
                    After completing the program at age 17, I worked towards my state certification s a Certified Nursing Assistant which allowed me to get my first job in a nursing home.
                    This job has been the hardest I have ever worked on. 
                </p>
    
                <p class="bio">Then I went to college and got my nursing degree in 2006 from Biola university and became a registered nurse. 
                    I worked in a hospital for several years until 2011 when I started working at the Disneyland Resort.
                </p>
                
                <p class="bio">Working at the Disneyland Resort has been my favorite job. 
                    Something I enjoyed a lot has been the trivia/treasure hunt-themed-nights. 
                    We would organize these events once a year for all the nurses where we would get to dress up according to the theme picked for the night and have fun with everyone. 
    
                </p>
    
                <p class="bio">Working at the Disneyland resort has brought me several accomplishments.
                    In 2015, I was accepted into the Emerging Leaders program where new managers for the Disneyland Resort are selected. 
                    I successfully completed the program and became a manager for the Health Services department. 
                    Next year, in 2016 I was awarded the Walt Disney Legacy Award which is the highest recognition Cast Members can receive at the Walt Disney Company worldwide. 
                    Then in 2020 at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, I had the opportunity to help crew members and passengers in one of the Disney cruise ships. 
                    I worked on the cruise ship for five weeks and made sure that all crew and passengers were safe and healthy to return safely home.
